# hangman
Probably should have been able to make such a program way back, but I couldn't ever figure out how to make one properly with all the graphics. Until now. :) - 10/26/22


Yup, pretty simple, honestly. Just hangman. Updated it 6 months later to use a singular variable containing a list of each stage of hangman, printing every loop with 
the amount of points added up, starting at 0. Pretty genius if im gonna be honest.
